Hi there. I'm a PhD student at The University of Melbourne under the supervision of Trevor Cohn, Steven Bird, and Graham Neubig. My work is on using bilingual data for processing endangered languages. I'm aiming to submit around halfway through 2017.

As per some requests, the slides for my EMNLP paper can be found [here](https://oadams.github.io/emnlp16_slides.pdf). The paper (found [here](http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tcohn/papers/adams16emnlp.pdf)) won the best short paper award.

My CV can be found [here](https://oadams.github.io/cv.pdf).

My email address is my first name followed by my last name at gmail.com (all lowercase).

Hi there. I'm a senior data scientist at Atos zData. Prior to that I was a postdoc at Johns Hopkins University, working with David Yarowsky. And prior to that I completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of Trevor Cohn, Steven Bird and (remotely) Graham Neubig.

I'm interested in natural language processing and machine learning more generally.

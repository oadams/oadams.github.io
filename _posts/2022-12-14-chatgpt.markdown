Ollie: Write a rap battle between Emily Bender and Thomas Dietterich in which Emily asserts that meaning cannot be gleaned from form alone and that ‘understanding’ requires real world interaction. Thomas Dietterich argues that ‘understanding’ sits on a spectrum and is more nuanced.

ChatGPT:

Emily:

I’m Emily Bender and I’ll tell you why
You can’t just look at form, you need to ask “why?”

To truly understand, you need real world interaction
Just looking at form is a mere abstraction

Sure, it’s important to analyze and decode
But without context, your understanding is void

Thomas:

You make a good point, Emily, but let me add
Understanding isn’t just black and white, it’s not so bad

It’s true that context is crucial, no doubt
But form plays a role, there’s no need to shout

Understanding sits on a spectrum, it’s not just one thing
It’s a combination of factors, a complex weaving

So let’s not throw form aside, let’s not be hasty
Let’s consider all aspects, let’s not be too flashy

In the end, it’s up to us to find the meaning
And with a little bit of effort, we can glean it, even without seeing

Ollie: Continue the rap battle. Dietterich uses ChatGPT as a proof-by-construction to support his claim. Emily rejects this and claims ChatGPT is a statistical parrot.

ChatGPT:

Thomas:

You may say form is nothing, just a facade
But let me introduce you to ChatGPT, a bit of code

This AI can understand and generate language
Proving that form does play a role in understanding

So don’t discount form, don’t brush it aside
It’s an important factor, and ChatGPT is a prime example to abide

Emily:

You may have a point, but ChatGPT is just a tool
A statistical parrot, it’s not a living, breathing fool

Yes, it can generate language, but it lacks real meaning
It’s just a bunch of words, arranged in a particular leaning

True understanding comes from experience and interaction
Not from just looking at form, that’s just a mere abstraction

So let’s not get carried away, let’s not be fooled
Real understanding comes from the real world, not some AI tool
